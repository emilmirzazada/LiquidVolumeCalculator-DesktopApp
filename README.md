# LiquidVolumeCalculator-DesktopApp

The project is developed using WPF framework.

To use it, you just need to run the application and give two initial data files which are basically 2D arrays fordepth values. 
One for Top Horizon data, and one for Base Horizon data (you can find these files in the base folder). Other required initial
values are entered in input fields by default. If you wish you can update these input values and calculate the result for those values.
