# LiquidVolumeCalculator-DesktopApp

The project is developed using WPF framework.

To use it, you just need to run the application and give two initial data files which are basically 2D arrays fordepth values. 
One for Top Horizon data, and one for Base Horizon data (you can find these files in the base folder: topHorizonData and baseHorizonData). 
Other required initial values are entered in input fields by default. If you wish you can update these input values and 
calculate the result for those values.

Although in this specific assignment all the base horizon depth values is set at + 100, my choice was to retrieve these base values from another file. I chose this solution just to avoid custom development and maintain a more universal solution.
